# LLM School Project

Had to do this for school... will be removing all private api keys so the code is not going to run correctly without it.

_In a .env file, add your own Google Gemini API Key to run the code._

Install the stuff -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the project -> `python src/main.py`
